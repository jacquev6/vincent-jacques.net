[IpMap](https://github.com/jacquev6/IpMap/) is a browsable map of the IPv4 address space inspired by [xkcd 195, Map of the Internet](https://xkcd.com/195/).
An [interactive demo](https://jacquev6.github.io/IpMap/) is available.

It's implemented in HTML5 and JavaScript, purely on the client side, using [jQuery](https://jquery.com/) and [jquery-mousewheel](https://github.com/jquery/jquery-mousewheel).

I've recently improved my knowledge of the JavaScript language and ecosystem.
I think this project would deserve some work to improve its code quality and maintainability.
But I keep it here because it's still working software.
