[vincent-jacques.net] is my personal website, the one you're looking at.

It's generated as a static website using [Nuxt.js] (thus [Vue.js], [Vue Router], [webpack], etc.)
and is hosted on [GitHub Pages].

On the client side, it's using [Bootstrap] (throught [BootstrapVue]), [Sass] and a little bit of [Font Awesome].
