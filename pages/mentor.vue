          Mentoring
        </vj-hdr>
        <vj-markdown>
          I'm offering my mentorship to software development students at all levels.

          This can be interesting for students in two situations:
          - your school is going too fast, you feel lost and you need help to catch up
          - your school is going too slow, you're bored and you'd like to talk about more advanced stuff

          What I can help you with:
          - understand everything I know about software development engineering (and I honestly know quite a lot)
          - understand the big picture of how computers and the internet work

          What I *cannot* help you with:
          - influence your grades (even if I'm teaching at your school)
          - do your homework
          - help you find a job

          I think a deep understanding of the fundamentals is key to learning new things efficiently,
          so I will try and explain the fundamentals you need, *before* going into the details.

        <vj-markdown>
          This is mostly up to you.

          As a start, I suggest we meet via Google Meet with small groups of students with similar priorities.
          We can then adapt to what would work best for you; just let me know.

          This is a no-commitment offer: you and I can stop whenever one of us wants, for whatever reason.

          If you want me to continue mentoring you, you should:
          - show up when we agree
          - ask questions, suggest topics
          - tell me how I'm doing, and what I can do to help you better

          Please note that even if I'm teaching at your school, this is an entirely extra-curricular offer,
          completely unrelated with your school.
          Your school's officials may even not *know* about it.
          (It's not a secret though.)

          Send me an email to [vincent.jacques@centraliens.net](mailto:vincent.jacques@centraliens.net?Subject=Mentoring) where you tell me:
          - if you prefer to speak French or English
          - where and what you study, at what level, etc. If I'm teaching one of your classes, tell me which one, in what group your are, etc.
          - if you feel school is going too slow or too fast
          - what you expect from this mentoring (in a few sentences)
