[IpMap] is a browsable map of the IPv4 address space inspired by [xkcd 195, Map of the Internet][xkcd-195].
An [interactive demo][IpMap-demo] is available.

It's implemented in HTML5 and [JavaScript], purely on the client side, using [jQuery] and [jquery-mousewheel].

I've recently improved my knowledge of the JavaScript language and ecosystem.
I think this project would deserve some work to improve its code quality and maintainability.
I keep it here because it's still working software.
