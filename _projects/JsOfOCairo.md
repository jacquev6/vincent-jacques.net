[JsOfOCairo](http://github.com/jacquev6/JsOfOCairo/) is a [OCaml](http://ocaml.org/) library to reuse Cairo-based drawing code in web browsers.

It's an adapter, implementing (a reasonable subset of) the interface of [Cairo OCaml](https://github.com/Chris00/ocaml-cairo/)
targeting HTML5 canvas elements as exposed to OCaml by [js_of_ocaml](https://ocsigen.org/js_of_ocaml/).
