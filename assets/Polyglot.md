[Polyglot] is a collection of examples of how to interface pieces of code written in different languages,
and/or execute code in a runtime environment that's not traditional for its language.
Calling a C++ library from a Python program, or executing OCaml code in a web browser,
are two examples amongst what *Polyglot* demonstrates.

It uses [many different technologies] to interface a few languages like C, [C++], [Python], [OCaml] and [JavaScript].
