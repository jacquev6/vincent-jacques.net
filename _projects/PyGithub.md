PyGithub
========

PyGithub is a [Python](https://www.python.org/) library to use the [GitHub API v3](https://developer.github.com/v3).
Here are [the reference documentation](https://jacquev6.github.io/PyGithub),
[the source code](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithub)
and [the PyPI package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyGithub).

I've also created [a web application demonstrating how to use OAuth with PyGithub](http://pygithub-oauth-demo.vincent-jacques.net). Here is [the source code](https://github.com/jacquev6/PyGithubOAuthDemo).
