              I'm Vincent Jacques, alias [@jacquev6] on the web.
              I'm a 35 years old, French, passionate software engineer.
              I started programming when I was 12 on a [Casio calculator],
              and haven't stopped learning since.

              [Casio calculator]: http://www.rskey.org/fx790p

              I studied general engineering at [Ecole Centrale Paris][ECP]
              (2006) and I specialized on software as a very enthusiastic career choice.

              After eleven years of professional software engineering, I value maintainable and evolutive source code
              and the use of tools and automation to create working, reliable software.

              As of September 2018, I'm **looking for my next job**.
              Maybe we can work together on your software project?

            # Portfolio {.px-1}

            Most of my projects are hosted on [GitHub][my-github]
            and have continuous build on [Travis CI][my-travis].

            My projects are documented using [Sphinx] and the [Alabaster] theme.
            Reference documentation is generated from [Python] source code by [autodoc],
            form [C++] source code by [Doxygen] and [Breathe],
            and from [OCaml] source code by a preliminary version of my [Sphinx extension for OCaml][sphinxcontrib-ocaml]

            My [Python] projects are distributed on the [Python package index][my-pypi], and my [OCaml] projects are published on [OPAM][my-opam].

            I hope you liked my portfolio and it made you want to work together!
            If yes, here is my [résumé (PDF)](/Vincent%20Jacques%20-%20resume.pdf).

            ## My dream job {.px-1}

            I'm pretty flexible about administrative status: I can either invoice you as a freelancer,
            or, if you are a French company, I can join your payroll.

            I aim at making the most of my time.
            Based on my work experience, I have identified below a few conditions that help me be as productive as possible.
            Of course this is just to give you a taste of what I'm looking for, and we don't have to be a 100% match.
            If you think we could be a good fit, please send me an [e-mail](mailto:vincent.jacques@centraliens.net) and let's discuss working together!

              ##### Working from home {.px-1}

              As my personal life is now organized around it, this is the most important for me.
              It gives me long uninterrupted focused work periods, the best for people on a [maker schedule](https://www.google.fr/search?q=maker+schedule+manager+schedule).
              Without the daily commute I feel less tired and I waste less time.
              This means I have more time for work *and* for myself.

              I've been doing that for a few years now.
              Regularly scheduled video meetings have been enough to keep projects on track.

              ##### Focusing on building technical solutions... {.px-1}

              I enjoy technical work.
              I like to dive deep in technical issues and create solutions as simple as possible.
              I wish to become a very potent expert rather than a manager, and I'm looking for a job that values that.

              My team should have the freedom to choose appropriate technical solutions with no arbitrary technological constraints.
              It should be responsible for solving problems, and decide *how* (in the context allowed by said problem: there may be actual technological constraints.)

              ##### ...for actual business problems {.px-1}

              I need to understand the business big picture, to keep in mind *why* we are doing anything.
              The question of exactly *what* we should do, however, is probably better answered by domain specialists.
              Regular, bi-directional, communication with them is key to successful projects.

          <div class="col-md">
            {{#md}}
              ##### An application domain I enjoy {.px-1}

              These are purely personal preferences with *no value judgment*.
              I would rather not work in a military or finance-related domain.
              I would be very happy to work in toys, hobby supplies, robots, software engineering tools, science.
              I would also like many other domains in the industry, transportations, tourism, culture... and many more I don't even know exist.

              ##### High moral standards {.px-1}

              This may seem obvious, but it is not.
              I'm looking for a job where laws and individuals are respected and that condemns any form of discrimination.
              Anyone should feel free to discuss ideas, behaviors and produced artifacts, and refrain from discussing people.
              There should be a culture of openness (about information and software) and knowledge spreading to reach a distributed technical excellence.
